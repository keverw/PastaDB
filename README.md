PastaDB 0.4
=======

Work with pasta, then we'll make the spaghetti! PastaDB aims to be a powerful yet simple database abstraction layer library.

Check the docs and examples folder to learn how to use it! RawPasta genreates the SQL strings, PastaDB runs the SQL and uses RawPasta when it needs to genreate SQL.
